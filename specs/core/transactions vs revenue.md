## Transactions vs. Revenue

### Transactions

Transactions are the broader category that represents any financial exchange in your business. These include:

- Money coming in (revenue/income)
- Money going out (expenses)
- Internal transfers
- Adjustments

Essentially, a transaction is any event that affects your financial position.

### Revenue

Revenue is specifically the income or money coming into your business from your core business activities, such as:

- Sales of products
- Provision of services
- Subscription fees
- Commissions earned

Revenue is a subset of transactions - specifically the incoming transactions that represent your business earnings.

## Why Revenue Entries Have Status

Revenue entries have status indicators (unlike general expense transactions) for several important reasons:

### 1. Payment Lifecycle

Revenue often follows a clear lifecycle:

- **Expected/Promised** - A client has agreed to pay but hasn't yet
- **Invoiced** - You've formally requested payment
- **Paid** - You've received the payment
- **Overdue** - Payment was due but hasn't been received

### 2. Cash Flow Management

The status helps distinguish between:

- **Accrued Revenue** - Revenue you've earned but haven't received payment for yet
- **Realized Revenue** - Revenue where you've actually received the money

This distinction is crucial for cash flow planning and forecasting.

### 3. Accounts Receivable Tracking

When you provide goods or services before receiving payment, you need to track:

- Who owes you money
- How much they owe
- When it's due
- Whether it's overdue

The status field provides this tracking capability.

### 4. Invoice Integration

Revenue often ties directly to invoices in a business context:

- **Draft** - Initial revenue entry before formal invoicing
- **Invoiced** - An invoice has been created and sent
- **Partially Paid** - Some of the invoiced amount has been received
- **Paid** - Full payment received
- **Overdue** - Payment deadline has passed

### 5. Collection Actions

Different statuses trigger different business actions:

- **Invoiced** → Wait for payment
- **Overdue (30 days)** → Send reminder
- **Overdue (60 days)** → Follow-up call
- **Overdue (90+ days)** → Consider collections

In contrast, expenses typically have a simpler lifecycle. Once you record an expense, it represents money that has already left your business (or a commitment to pay that you'll handle through accounts payable). The payment action is often separate from the expense recording, which is why expense transactions typically don't need the same kind of status tracking as revenue.

This status-based approach to revenue management in FinanceFlow enables proper financial control and visibility over your incoming cash flow, which is crucial for business sustainability.
